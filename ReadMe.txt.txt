# 📊 Superstore EDA Project

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project analyzes Superstore sales data to identify patterns in 
sales, profit, discounts, and sub-category performance.

## 🔹 Key Insights
- Copiers generate consistently high profits, Machines generate losses.
- Discounts above 40% consistently lead to negative profits.
- Sales above 8k are always profitable, low-mid sales orders are volatile.

## 🔹 Business Recommendations
- Limit discounts above 40% to protect margins.
- Focus on high-ticket corporate orders (Copiers, Machines) for profit stability.
- Monitor loss-making sub-categories (Machines, Tables) and optimize costs.
